- **Preload Script** (`src/preload.ts`): Secure API bridge with contextBridge
- **Renderer UI** (`renderer/index.html`): Beautiful glass morphism interface
- **UI Logic** (`renderer/renderer.js`): Navigation, interactions, status checking

#### Testing Infrastructure
- OpenAI integration test script
- Firebase Firestore connection test
- Receipt parsing schema validation
- Error handling test cases

### Project Metrics - Day 0
- **Files Created**: 22
- **Lines of Code**: 5,047
- **Documentation Pages**: 11
- **Test Scripts**: 2
- **Dependencies**: 5 core packages
- **Commits**: 1 comprehensive initial commit

### Architecture Decisions

#### Technology Stack Rationale
- **Electron**: Cross-platform desktop application framework
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and developer experience
- **Firebase**: Reliable cloud database with offline support
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Cost-effective AI with function calling
- **N8N**: Visual workflow automation platform
- **Tesseract**: Open-source OCR engine

#### Design Principles Established
1. **Privacy First**: Images never leave device, only OCR text processed
2. **Local Processing**: OCR and file operations performed locally
3. **Beautiful UX**: Modern glass morphism design with smooth interactions
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from day one
5. **Performance**: Sub-30-second receipt processing target
6. **Security**: Encrypted storage, input validation, secure communications

### Development Process

#### Workflow Established
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commits
- **Documentation**: Markdown with Mermaid diagrams
- **Testing**: Jest + Spectron for comprehensive coverage
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict mode
- **Deployment**: Electron Builder for multi-platform distribution

#### Project Management
- 4-day sprint methodology
